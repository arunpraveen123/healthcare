<h1>The Treatment Cost Advantage in India</h1>
<p>India is the sought after location for organ transplant, orthopedic, cardiology, urology, fertility/reproductive health and oncology problems. As per Patient Beyond Borders, the <strong>average saving in India for key specialties and procedures is nearly 65-90% cheaper than the US</strong> and much lower than competing countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Korea, etc. Further, the INR depreciation by 13% last year has also aided medical tourism in India, and as per an Assocham study the number of <strong>medical tourists coming to India has risen by 40% </strong>during the period of sharp INR depreciation. It also have been observed that the <strong>INR depreciation has reduced cost of complex surgeries by 35-45% for patients from Middle East, Africa and SAARC countries</strong>.<br><br>
Health care costs in India can run as low as ten cents on the dollar compared to the US or the UK. Popular treatments include bone-marrow transplants, eye surgery and hip grafting and replacement. <strong>India is also a top destination for cardiac bypass surgery </strong>at various hospitals; the <strong>procedure can cost less than $10,000 as compared to more than $100,000 in the West</strong>.</p>

        <h4 class="modal-title" style="color:#000;">WHY INDIA AS MEDICAL TREATMENT DESTINATION</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body trea_hahah">
       <h1><img src="images/w1.jpg" class="img-responsive"></h1>
       
       <p>India has become a top health tourism destination for patients across the globe for high-end surgeries at inexpensive prices. Two of the top ten medical tourism hospitals are based in India. <br><br>
India is emerging as a preferred healthcare destination for Stories of <strong>Westerners traveling to India and saving 75% over home country costs for large procedures-travel costs included-are not uncommon</strong>.<br><br>
A growing number of tourists are flocking in large numbers because of the superlative medical care, equipment and facilities that India offers at affordable costs. India is considered a highly effective center for specialized treatments such as open-heart surgery, hip & knee replacement, pediatric, cardiac surgery, dentistry, bone marrow transplant, cosmetic surgery, and therapy of cancer, among others. The Indian government is easing restrictions on citizens of many countries, making it easier for them to travel to India, visa-free and with fewer restrictions (US citizens do need a visa to enter India, which costs $67 plus any agency service fees).</p>
       
       <p>India is in the process of becoming the "Global Health Destination" owing to the following advantages:<br><br>
       
   <i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>        The cost of medical services in India is almost 30% lower to that in Western countries and the cheapest in South-east Asia.<br>
<i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>    The cost of Infertility treatments in India is almost 1/4th of that in developed nations. The availability of modern assisted reproductive techniques, such as IVF, and a full range of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) services have made India the first choice for infertility treatments.<br>
<i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>    Language is a major comfort factor that invites so many foreign tourists to visit India for medical and health tourism. India has a large populace of good English speaking doctors, guides and medical staff. This makes it easier for foreigners to relate well to Indian doctors.<br>
<i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>    Indian hospitals excel in cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery, joint replacements, transplants, cosmetic treatments, dental care, Orthopaedic surgery and more.<br>

</p>

 <h1>A. Fast Track-Zero Waiting Time</h1>  
 <p>Quick and immediate attention for surgeries and all interventions are assured in India. Getting an appointment for bypass surgery or a planned angioplasty in certain countries takes almost 3-6 months. And there these treatments are very costly too. It’s zero waiting time in India for any procedure, be it heart surgery, kidney care, cancer treatment, neuro-spinal procedure, knee/hip/joint replacements, dental, cosmetic surgeries, weight loss surgery etc.</p>
 
 <h1>B. Feeling the pulse</h1>
 <p>For greater understanding between patients and healthcare personnel, the warmth and hospitality of Indian hospitals is a big factor in choosing India as a healthcare destination. Among the top medical destinations of the world, India has the highest percentage of English language speaking people. Amidst the variety of culture and traditions, if there is one thing that is common in India, that is the English language. If other language options are essential, there are expert interpreters who will be some time arranged by the hospitals. All leading to reassuring hospitality and great after care. </p>
 
 <h1>C. Skilled and well-qualified doctors </h1>
 
 <p>Doctors tend to be highly trained, due to large medical tourism cities like Chennai and Noida having foreign patients fill half their hospital beds. Also, the language barrier is lower for English speakers, and Indian hospitals are bringing in translators for non-English speaking foreigners. Indian doctors and surgeons are well known throughout the world for their skills and research. This country offers you the services of some of the world's highest-qualified medical professionals along with top-class biomedical facilities. </p>
 
 <h1>D. Customized services</h1>
 
 <p>Here, patients can avail healthcare benefits in facilities varying in size from small, specialized clinics to large, multi-specialty hospitals. India's offerings are classified into a range of categories that can suit every budget and every need. </p>
 
 <h1>E. Use of latest technologies</h1>
 <p>ndian hospitals are equipped with highly advanced equipment and use latest technologies to offer sophisticated medical services that are easily comparable to those offered by developed countries. 
The drivers for growth in medical tourism in India are lower cost, scale and range of treatments, internationally accredited healthcare facilities (~19 JCI-accredited hospitals), availability of skilled doctors/nursing staff, sophisticated medical technology and infection control processes without the long waiting period of the developed countries.</p>
    <h1><img src="images/we.png" class="img-responsive"></h1> 
    
    <h1>F. Growing Trends</h1>
    
    <p>As per estimates, around 1.7 lakh foreigners fly to India for medical treatment every year, to avail world class personalized healthcare services. Indian hospitals meet international standards of cleanliness and hygiene and their top-class infrastructure suits the needs of patients coming for treatments such as heart surgery, knee replacement, orthopaedic treatments, cosmetic surgery, eye care, dental treatment or any other healthcare need.</p>

       <h1>Kidney Transplant Specialist India</h1>
       
       <p>A Kidney Transplant is required by a patient who is suffering from end stage renal failure. End-stage renal failure is the name for kidney failure so advanced that it cannot be revived. End-stage renal disease cannot be treated with conventional medical treatments such as medicines. There are only two kinds of treatments possible,</p>
       
       <h1>Dialysis and Kidney Transplant. </h1>
       <p><strong>(a) Dialysis</strong> is the method of artificially filtering the blood. People who require dialysis are required to take it periodically and regularly and are generally confined to the home because of their dialysis schedule, fragile health, or both. </p>
       <p><strong>(b) Kidney transplantation</strong> means replacement of at least one of the failed kidneys with a working kidney from another person, called a donor. Many people who receive a kidney transplant are able to live a similar quality of life as they did before they reached end stage renal disease.</p>
       <p> A donor is carefully chosen by the transplant experts by matching Tissue and Blood so that the chances of acceptance are higher and the risk of failure is minimal.</p>
       <p>Various hospitals now do Kidney Transplants in India. Removal of the donor’s kidney is also now done with Robotic procedures in the few hospitals.</p>
       
       <h1>Liver Transplant Specialist India</h1>
       <p>Liver Transplant is often recommended as an option when other modes of treatment are not successful. The purpose is to replace your diseased liver with a healthy liver. Ideally, after a transplant the patient will be free from disease, and lead a fairly normal life as long as the transplant functions. </p>
       <p>Liver transplantation nowadays is a well-accepted treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure. The surgical procedure is very demanding and ranges from 4 to 18 hours depending on outcome and patients profile. Numerous anastomoses and sutures, and many disconnections and reconnections of abdominal and hepatic tissue, must be made for the transplant to succeed, requiring an eligible recipient and a well-calibrated liver or cadaveric donor match. </p>
       
       <h1>There are three options for liver transplantation-</h1>
       
       <p>(a) Cadaver donor transplantation.</p>
<p>(b) Living donor transplantation</p>
<p>(c) Auxiliary transplantation.</p>

<p><strong>Cadaver donor:</strong> The donor liver is obtained from a person who is diagnosed as brain dead, whose family volunteers to donate the organ for transplantation. People who receive cadaver donors wait on the institutional / regional list until a suitable donor becomes available. </p>
   
   <p><strong>Living donor:</strong> A healthy family member, usually a person of blood relation, sibling, or child, or someone emotionally close to you, such as a spouse, volunteers to donate part of their liver for transplantation. The donor is carefully evaluated by the team to ensure that no harm comes to the donor or recipient. </p>
       
       <p><strong>Auxiliary transplantation:</strong> Part of the liver of a healthy adult donor (living or cadaver) is transplanted into the recipient. The patient's diseased liver remains intact until the auxiliary piece regenerates and assumes function. The diseased liver may then be removed. This technique is rarely used now.</p>
       <h1>Cornea Transplant Specialist India</h1>
       
       <p>The cornea is the clear layer on the front of the eye. A corneal transplant is surgery to replace the cornea with tissue from a donor. It is one of the most common transplants done.<br><br>
 In some diseased conditions the cornea becomes cloudy or warped due to disease, injury or infection. A damaged cornea distorts light as it enters the eye causing decreased vision. This kind of visual impairment is called corneal blindness. This is the only type of visual impairment that can be treated by corneal transplantation. <br><br>
Corneal transplantation or corneal grafting is a surgical procedure where the damaged cornea is replaced by donated corneal tissue (the graft) in its entirety (penetrating keratoplasty) or in part (lamellar keratoplasty). The graft is taken from a recently deceased individual with no known diseases or other factors that may affect the viability of the donated tissue or the health of the recipient.<br><br>
The surgical procedure is performed by ophthalmologist, medical experts who specialize in this area.</p>

<h1>Bone Marrow Transplants India</h1>

<p>Bone Marrow Transplantation is a form of intensive treatment used to treat certain cancers like leukemia, lymphomas and some serious diseases like thalassaemia.<br><br>
Bone marrow is found inside our bones tissues, and is the main site for blood production in the body. It is responsible for producing white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets cells. Stem cells are blood cells at their earliest stage of development in the bone marrow, before they have become committed to developing into white cells, red cells or platelets. It is these 'mother' cells, which are the key factors in transplantation.<br><br>
There are two main types of transplants – Autologous and Allogenic.</p>

<p><strong>Autologous Transplants:</strong> This means that the bone marrow or stem cells used for the transplant are one's own. A little bit of the patient's bone marrow or stem cells is taken and stored before high dose treatment. When the treatment is over, the bone marrow or stem cells are given back through a vein.</p>


<p><strong>Allogeneic Transplants:</strong> In this type of transplant, bone marrow donated by someone else is used. It is essential that the donor's tissue match. The most suitable donor is usually a close relative, most commonly a brother or sister. It is possible to get a good match from an unrelated donor, but this facility does not exist in India.</p>

<h1>Heart Transplant in India</h1>

<p>A Heart Transplant is done a patient with end stage heart failure or very severe Coronary Artery Disease. A brain dead donor or recently deceased patient’s heart is removed and implanted in to the patient after doing several blood and tissue matching to ensure least rejections.
The concept of organ donation after death (cadaver donor) is picking up in India and will still take some more years that the relatives of the deceased would voluntarily come forward for donation to save many lives.</p>
